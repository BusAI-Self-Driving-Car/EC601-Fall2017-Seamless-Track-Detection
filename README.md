## Lane Detection Programs Tested

[**Advanced Lane Detection by George Sung**](https://github.com/georgesung/advanced_lane_detection) - Working on Python3.5,OpenCV 3.1.0, NumPy 1.13.3. Requires particular files/information for camera calibration.

[**Lane Tracking - by FrenkT**](https://github.com/FrenkT/LaneTracking) - Fails to run on Python3.5,OpenCV 3.1.0, NumPy 1.13.3, but upon further inspection it does not actually do anything. Originally added it due to the ReadMe saying it used Kalman filtering for lane tracking. 

[**Lane Detection - by vinaykumarhs2020**](https://github.com/vinaykumarhs2020/lane_detection) - Program is only for detecting lanes on a raod in picture form and the code that is demoed for video is not included. 

[**Machine Learning MLND-Capstone - by mvirgo**](https://github.com/mvirgo/MLND-Capstone) - 

[**Advanced-Lane-and-Vehicle-Detection - by muddassir235**](https://github.com/muddassir235/Advanced-Lane-and-Vehicle-Detection) -  Program does more than we needed it to and we were unable to get the program file to run.  Large program only linked insead of reuploading.

[**Advanced-Lane-Lines - by NikolasEnt**](https://github.com/NikolasEnt/Advanced-Lane-Lines) - First program we tried.
