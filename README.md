# EC601-Fall2017-Seamless-Track-Detection

## Lane Detection Programs Tested

** [Advanced Lane Detection by George Sung](https://github.com/georgesung/advanced_lane_detection) ** - Working on Python3.5,OpenCV 3.1.0, NumPy 1.13.3. Requires particular files/information for camera calibration.

** [Lane Tracking - by FrenkT](https://github.com/FrenkT/LaneTracking) ** - Files to run on Python3.5,OpenCV 3.1.0, NumPy 1.13.3, but upon further inspection it does not actually do anything. Originally added it due to the ReadMe saying it used Kalman filtering for lane tracking.
